  "message": "HistoryBackend: Drop HistoryDBTasks in Closing()\n\nHistoryBackend's destructor ensures (via DCHECK) that there is no\nscheduled commit, i.e. basically that Closing() has been called just\nbefore.\nThis could be violated if there was a posted HistoryDBTask at the time\nClosing() was run: The task would keep a refptr to the HistoryBackend,\nso it'd delay the destructor invocation.\n\nThis CL fixes that by wrapping any current posted HistoryDBTask into\na CancelableOnceClosure, similar to what's done for the\n`scheduled_commit_`. That allows us to cancel the task in Closing().\n\nBug: 354474887\nChange-Id: I946d8a2bf90c0a9c124f982ba609425cdeea64e4\nReviewed-on: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/5724455\nReviewed-by: Sophie Chang <sophiechang@chromium.org>\nCommit-Queue: Marc Treib <treib@chromium.org>\nCr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/main@{#1331602}",
