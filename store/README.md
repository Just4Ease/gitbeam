# Event Store
### For this example, I have implemented a channel-based pub/sub system. 
This will be used as our messaging system to demonstrate choreographic activities via events.

In the real world, we would be using an Apache Pulsar, Nats.io, Kafka, RabbitMQ or any standard distributed messaging system. Building this out is to also demonstrate my use of events and pubsub system. 

Nothing serious :)
